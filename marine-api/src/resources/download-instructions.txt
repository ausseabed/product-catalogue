To perform bulk downloads of the data using file links, we recommend downloading from the National Computational
Infrastructure using a program like wget. Linux command line examples would be:

wget -x <URL>.

or

wget -x -i <URL List File>.

For Windows users, we recommend using a Linux emulator (e.g. Cygwin - http://www.cygwin.com) to perform these tasks,
or wget for Windows (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm).
